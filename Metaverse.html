   <h1>METAVERSE</h1>
   <p>The author, Neal Stephenson, in credited with coining the term metaverse which first appeared in his 1992 science fiction book Snow Crash. In that story, humans in the form of avatars interact with each other in a 3D world.<br><br>
      If we look to gaming to understand the metaverse and how it will change the way we relate to technology and each other in ways imagined and unimagined today, there is one standout example right now. The popular gaming platform, Fortnite, is reportedly developing a shared, gaming world where players and brands interact in the same physical-adjacent virtual space.<br><br>
      The term ‘meta’ means ‘beyond’ and so the metaverse is the extension of the universe of physical and virtual reality. The metaverse is that collective, shared virtual space that is created when the physical realm converges with the virtual realm, which includes virtual reality, augmented reality and the internet.<br><br>
      For an easy shorthand to understand the metaverse think of Steven Spielberg’s 2018 film, Ready Player One, in which a young gamer hides the keys to his real-world fortune for another player to discover after his death. In the metaverse we can link the physical world with a digital copy of the physical world in an enhanced virtual world.
