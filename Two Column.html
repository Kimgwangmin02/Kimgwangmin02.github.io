        <h2>Kate Middleton ‘mortified’ by Meghan Markle telling Oprah she made her cry</h2>
        <p>The Duchess of Cambridge is said to be “mortified” and “saddened” by the Duchess of Sussex ’s claims about their alleged argument in the bombshell Oprah interview.

            During the interview, which aired in the UK last week, Meghan alleged that her sister-in-law Kate made her cry in 2018, rather than the other way around, as was widely reported by the tabloids at the time.
            
            According to Meghan, reports of the women feuding over flower girl dresses before the royal wedding were true to an extent, but it was she who had ended up in tears.
            
            “I don’t say that to be disparaging to anyone because it was a really hard week of the wedding and she was upset about something,” Meghan said.
            
            “A few days before the wedding, [Kate] was upset about something. Yes, the issue was correct about flower girl dresses.”
            
            Meghan added that the altercation “made [her] cry” and that Kate “owned it and apologised” to her with a handwritten note and flowers.

            “And she did what I would do if I knew that I hurt someone, right, to just take accountability for it,” the duchess said, adding that it wouldn’t be fair to get into the details because Kate had apologised to her.
            
            Now, royal expert Katie Nicholls has said that Kate is unhappy with Meghan’s claims and that she would never have wanted the issue to be brought up in public again.
            
            “From what I hear, there are different versions of the bridesmaid story, not just the one Meghan discussed,” Nicholls told OK Magazine.
            
            “Kate felt it was all sorted, so to have it brought up again was mortifying. Kate is not in a position to respond and Meghan and Harry know that.”

            Nicholls added that Kate has “never wanted” reports of a rift with Meghan to be published in the press.
            
            “Kate is so discreet and respects her personal life,” she continued.
            
            “You never hear about her falling out with anyone because she is very careful with how she treats others. Kate and William both feel they were hugely welcoming to Meghan and Harry.”</p>

        <h2>Biden to hold first news conference March 25
        </h2>
        <p>President Joe Biden will hold his first formal news conference on March 25, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Tuesday.

            While the president has periodically taken questions from reporters, Biden has been under increased fire from conservative news outlets — as well as some political allies — for waiting longer than some predecessors to hold a media availability after taking office.
            
            Should the March 25 date hold, Biden will have gone more than two full months without holding a news conference to start his tenure. Recent past presidents have typically done so within their first month as a good-faith gesture toward the free press.
            
            The White House is stepping up its media presence as part of an effort to promote the recently enacted $1.9 trillion stimulus package and tout the continual progress in scaling up coronavirus vaccinations. On Tuesday, Biden traveled to Pennsylvania, and other emissaries are also spreading out across the country as part of a planned blitz.
            
            The Biden administration initially won plaudits for reinstating daily press briefings, a practice that atrophied under former President Donald Trump, who preferred to act as his own spokesperson and often engaged with reporters in freewheeling exchanges that caused heartburn for his administration.
            
            Earlier in his political career, Biden had a reputation for committing gaffes, and he and his team had been cautious to ensure message discipline on the campaign trail and during the first weeks of his presidency. However, the president has at times strayed, with his comments that states rushing to lift Covid-related restrictions were exhibiting “ neanderthal thinking. ”
            
            The derisive remark stoked Republican outrage for days as Congress worked to push through the relief package.
